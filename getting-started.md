# Getting started

Xethya is built from a modular perspective, so you can select exactly what you need.

The `@xethya` package scope contains all of the components officially provided by the framework. Getting started is as easy as:

```bash
$ npm install @xethya/<component>
```

and requiring it later.

This framework has been designed to work both server-side and client-side, so you can use it on a Node or browser context.
